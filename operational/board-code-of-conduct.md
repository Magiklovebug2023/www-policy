Participation in The OWASP Foundation (“OWASP”) Board of Directors (the “Board”) is conditional upon each member of the Board (each a “Director”) adhering to the requirements of this Board of Directors Code of Conduct (the “Board Code of Conduct”). By participating on the Board, each Director agrees to comply with the following:

## Board Conduct Generally

Each Director, including the Board Chair and Vice-Chair, has an equal vote on all matters presented to the Board. No Director has more power than any other. Each Director is responsible for monitoring and ensuring OWASP’s progress in attaining its goals and objectives while pursuing its mission. The work of the Board is a team effort.

Accordingly, in order to assist the Board in governing, promoting and ensuring positive and productive relationships between and among the Directors and OWASP staff, when performing Board duties or acting as a representative of OWASP or the OWASP community, all Directors are expected to:

- Comply with the [OWASP Code of Conduct](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/code-of-conduct) and all OWASP policies
- Keep in mind the [OWASP Core Values](https://owasp.org/about/#core-values), and this Board Code of Conduct
- Fully participate in Board of Directors meetings and other public forums
- Treat others with respect, kindness, consideration and courtesy
- Be responsive and engage in attentive listening
- Prepare in advance of Board meetings and be familiar with issues on the agenda
- Work together as a collaborative process, assisting each other in conducting Board affairs
- Be respectful of other people’s time
- Stay focused and act efficiently during public meetings
- Serve as a model of leadership and civility to the community
- Demonstrate honesty and integrity in every action and statement
- Participate in scheduled activities to increase team effectiveness
- Review Board procedures and OWASP policies, such as this Board Code of Conduct

## Board Conduct with One Another

- Practice civility and respect in all Board discussions and debates, including by respecting each Director's dignity, style, values, and opinions.
- Avoid belligerent behaviors and personal comments that could offend other Directors, notwithstanding that difficult questions, tough challenges to particular points of view, and criticism of ideas and information are legitimate elements of a free democracy in action.
- Honor the Chair's role in maintaining order. It is the Chair's responsibility to keep the directors' comments on track during public meetings. Directors should honor the Chair's efforts to focus discussion on current agenda items. If there is disagreement about the agenda or the Chair’s actions, those objections should be voiced politely and with reason.
- Demonstrate practical problem-solving approaches. Directors have a public stage to show how individuals with disparate and differing points of view can find common ground and seek a compromise that benefits the community.
- Respect differing viewpoints in the decision-making process. Individuals have the right to disagree with ideas and opinions, but without being disagreeable.
- Once the Board of Directors acts, Directors should support said action with a united approach and without public dissension or creating barriers to the implementation of said action.

## Board Conduct with OWASP Staff

The board's primary responsibility is to formulate and evaluate OWASP policy. Routine operational matters are to be delegated to OWASP professional staff.

- Treat all staff as professionals with civility, respect, and clear, honest communication that respects all involved's abilities, experience, and dignity. 
- Poor behavior towards staff is not acceptable. Directors should develop a working relationship with the Executive Director wherein current issues, concerns, and OWASP projects can be discussed comfortably and openly.
- Never publicly criticize or express concern about the performance of OWASP staff or any member thereof. Such comments should only be made to the Executive Director through private correspondence or conversation.
- Do not get involved in administrative functions.

The Board’s authority to make decisions regarding OWASP policy or other matters is exercised through Board meetings and communications with the Executive Director or appropriate OWASP staff supervisor.

If approached by OWASP personnel concerning specific OWASP policy, Directors should direct inquiries to the appropriate staff supervisor or Executive Director. The chain of command should be followed.

## Board Conduct with the Public

- When responding to community requests and concerns, Directors should be courteous, positively respond to individuals, and route their questions through appropriate channels to responsible management personnel.
- Refer all complaints to the Executive Director.
- Make no promises on behalf of OWASP. 
- Directors are frequently asked to explain a Board action or give their opinion about an issue as they meet and talk with the community members. It is appropriate to briefly overview OWASP policy and refer to OWASP staff for further information. It is inappropriate to promise Board action overtly or implicitly or promise that OWASP staff will do something specific.
- Do not make personal or derogatory comments about other Directors or their opinions or actions. The community is constantly observing directors. Honesty and respect for the dignity of other Directors should be reflected in every word and action taken by each Director, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

## Board Conduct with Other Organizations

When speaking outside of OWASP on matters relating to OWASP, be clear whether your views are yours or OWASP’s.

If a Director appears before another organization or governmental agency to give a statement on an issue, the Director must clearly state whether that statement: 

1) reflects a personal opinion or is the official OWASP stance; and 
2) is the majority or minority opinion of the Board.

If a Director represents OWASP, the Director must support and advocate the official OWASP position on an issue, not a personal viewpoint.

If a Director is representing another organization whose position is different from OWASP, the Director should withdraw from voting on the issue if it significantly impacts or is detrimental to OWASP’s interest.

Directors should be clear about which organizations they represent and inform the Executive Director and Board of their involvement.

Correspondence should also be equally clear about representations made on behalf of OWASP as opposed to personal or separate business interests.

## Sanctions

The Board may remove any Director due to repeated violation of the Board Code of Conduct pursuant to the last sentence of [Section 4.5 of the OWASP By-laws](https://owasp.org/www-policy/legal/bylaws#section-45-resignation-and-removal).
